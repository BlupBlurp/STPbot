All together, you can bring the shiny rate to 11/4096.\n\nThis compounds with [radar chaining](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917239249747738624/1167318977953935370/image.png), adding one roll for each tier you achieve. (Credit to Chee for the math/image.)\n\n***Nothing*** is shiny locked in Luminescent Platinum! For gifts, you must get to their Pok√©dex entry page to check their shininess.\n\nWe additionally offer a [trade](https://luminescent.team/docs/special-events/trade) for a Masuda Method 6IV Ditto in the game.")
