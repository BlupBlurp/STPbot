				"Luminescent Platinum's shiny rate is 8/4096 (1/512). This means that the shiny charm (+2) brings it to 10/4096, and the Masuda Method (+6) brings it to 14/4096. All together, you can bring the shiny rate to 16/4096.\n\nThis compounds with [radar chaining](https://i.imgur.com/lJvcQBo.jpeg), adding one roll for each tier you achieve. (Credit to *chee* for the math/image.)\n\n***Nothing*** is shiny locked in Luminescent Platinum! For gifts, you must get to their Pok√©dex entry page to check their shininess.\n\nWe additionally offer a [trade](https://luminescent.team/docs/special-events/trade) for a Masuda Method 6IV Ditto in the game.",
