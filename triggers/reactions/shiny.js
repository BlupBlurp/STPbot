				"Luminescent Platinum's shiny rate is 8/4096 (1/512). This means that the shiny charm (+1) brings it to 9/4096, and the Masuda Method (+2) brings it to 10/4096. All together, you can bring the shiny rate to 11/4096.\n\nThis compounds with [radar chaining](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917239249747738624/1167491975231066183/image.png?ex=654e52a1&is=653bdda1&hm=8043bff359b11850c02bf8bd5ada206ef9bafe326f33ceac948ad7d0738d5a87&), adding one roll for each tier you achieve. (Credit to *chee* for the math/image.)\n\n***Nothing*** is shiny locked in Luminescent Platinum! For gifts, you must get to their Pok√©dex entry page to check their shininess.\n\nWe additionally offer a [trade](https://luminescent.team/docs/special-events/trade) for a Masuda Method 6IV Ditto in the game.",
