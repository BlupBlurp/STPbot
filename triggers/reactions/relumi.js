It will also include extra story, all fights redone to include the new 'mons, expanded legendary quests (3.1+) and many other quality of life features that we are unable to do with the backend used in 2.0F/Luminescent Platinum.\n\nSaves will not be compatible between 2.0 and 3.0 because of how we will be changing the backend engine adjustments.\n\nSince this is a volunteer project with massive amounts of work still to go, we have no ETA when it will be available, and ask for your patience.",
